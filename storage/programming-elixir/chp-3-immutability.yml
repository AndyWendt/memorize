- question: How do most languages handle compound data structures and how does Elixir?
  answer: |
    Most languages pass them by reference and thus create challenges for parallel programming
    and just deciphering how the variables got to where they are.

    Elixir's data is immutable.  It copies values whenever it changes them

- question: What is the [ head | tail ] operator?
  answer: |
    It adds something to either the head or tail to create a new list:

    ```
    iex(1)> list1 = [3,2,1]
    [3, 2, 1]
    iex(2)> list2 = [4|list1]
    [4, 3, 2, 1]
    ```

- question: How does Elixir handle garbage collection?
  answer: |
    An Elixir application is divvied up between multiple processes and each process
    has its own heap so each individual heap is much smaller. Garbage collection
    thus runs much faster.
