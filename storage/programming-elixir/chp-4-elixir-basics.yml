- question: What are the value types?
  answer: |
    - Arbitrary-sized integers
    - Floating-point numbers
    - Atoms
    - Ranges
    - Regular expressions
  tags: []

- question: What are the system types?
  answer: |
    - PIDs and ports
    - References
  tags: []

- question: What are the collection types?
  answer: |
    - Tuples
    - Lists
    - Maps
    - Binaries
  tags: []

- question: What is the string type in Elixir?
  answer: |
    It is made up of other Elixir types.
  tags: []

- question: How can integers be represented?
  answer: |
    - Decimal (Can contain underscores)
    - Hexadecimal
    - Octal
    - Binary
  tags: []

- question: What precision are floats and what is their maximum exponent?
  answer: |
    * IEEE 754 precision which is precise to 16 digits
    * Max exponent of 10^308
  tags: []

- question: What can an Atom be comprised of?
  answer: |
    UTF-8 letters & combining marks, digits, underscores, @.  Can end with ! or ?.
  tags: []

- question: How are regular expressions represented?
  answer: |
    * ~{regexp} or ~{regexp}opts
    * The semicolons can be swapped out for other delimeters but they are better than forward slash since
      you have to escape less inside the expression.
  tags: []

- question: What is an Elixir Tuple?
  answer: |
    It is an ordered collection of values with typically 2 to 4 elements.
  tags: []

- question: How are Tuples typically used in regards to function returns?
  answer: |
    * First element is often `"ok"` if everything processed well
      * {:ok, "next"}
    * Errors: {:error, :enoent}
  tags: []

- question: Which type is closest to an array?
  answer: |
    Tuple.  Lists are not since they are a linked data structure.
  tags: []

- question: What is the most efficient way to accesss a list element?  The most expensive?
  answer: |
    * Linearly is the most efficient
    * Random is the most inefficient
    * Head and tail are cheap
  tags: []

- question: What are Keyword Lists?
  answer: |
    They are lists of two value tuples:

    [foo: true, baz: false] turns into [{foo: true}, {baz: false}]

    Can leave off brackets if the last argument in a function call.
  tags: []

- question: What are maps?
  answer: |
    They are collections of key/value pairs.

    %{ "AL" => "Alabama" }

    Keys can be tuples, strings, atoms. Same key type in the same map is NOT required

    Use square bracket syntax for access
  tags: []

- question: What is the difference between Maps and Keywoard Lists?
  answer: |
    The keys in keyword lists can be repeated.  Use maps for an associative array and use Keyword lists for command-line params.
  tags: []

- question: What do you use for representing dates & times in Elxir?
  answer: |
    * Use DateTime and NaiveDateTime respectively
  tags: []

- question: What can elixir identifiers start with?
  answer: |
    Letter/underscore followed by letters, digits, and underscores
  tags: []

- question: What identifiers start with an uppercase letter?
  answer: |
    Module, record, protocol, and behavior
  tags: []

- question: What is unique about true, false, and nil?
  answer: |
    They all are aliases for atoms of the same name and they are equal
  tags: []

- question: What is unique about Elixir comparisons?
  answer: |
    You can compare values of different types.  If they are compatible, the comparison uses natural ordering. Otherwise,
    the following rule is used:

    number < atom < reference < function < port < pid < tuple < map < list < binary
  tags: []

- question: What are the boolean operators and their special constraints?
  answer: |
    or, and, not only accept boolean comparisons without error
  tags: []

- question: What are the relaxed boolean comparisons?
  answer: |
    ||, &&, ! will accept arguments of any type.  false and nil are considered falsey.
  tags: []

- question: What is unique about integer division?
  answer: |
    It always returns a float
  tags: []

- question: How are variables scoped in Elixir?
  answer: |
    Lexically scoped.  Basic unit is the funciton body though modules also define a scope for variables at the top level of that module.
  tags: []

- question: How does elixir expect you to handle variable assignment inside of do...end blocks?
  answer: |
    That generates a warning.  Elixir expects you to use a case statement to assign or return
    and not assign inside of a do end block

    ```
    # Wrong
    case integer do
      1 -> atom = :one
      2 -> atom = :two
    end

    # Correct
    atom =
      case integer do
        1 -> :one
        2 -> :two
      end
  tags: []

- question: How is with used?
  answer: |
    * It can be used to define a local scope for variables
    * It gives you more control over pattern matching failures

    ```
    lp = with {:ok, file} = File.open("/etc/passwd"),
              content = IO.read(file, :all),
              :ok     = File.close(file)
              [_, uid, gid] = Regex.run(~/some-regex/m, content)
         do
            "Group: #{gid}, User: #{uid}"
         end
  tags: []

- question: What happens when you use the <- operator instead of an = in a with expression?
  answer: |
    It performs a match but if it fails, it returns the value that couldn't be matched
  tags: []

- question: How does Elixir treat `with` under the covers?
  answer: |
    It treats it as if it were a function or macro call
