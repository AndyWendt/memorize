- question: What is the `=`?
  answer: |
    It is the Match Operator.  It is more like an assertion than assignment.

    `a = 1` succeeds if it can make the left hand side equal the right hand.
    In this case it can since it can bind the variable `a` to the value `1`.

    However, the following does not work:

    ```
    a = 1
    1 = a
    2 = a # no match
    ```
