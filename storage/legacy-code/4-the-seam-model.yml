  answer: |
    A seam is a place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place.

    Make use of language features to expose seams.

- question: How do you define the types of seams in a programming language?
  answer: |
    Look at all of the steps involved in turning the text of a program
    into running code.  Each step exposes different types of seams.

- question: What are the types of seams?
  answer: |
    * Preprocessing
      * only in languages that have a build step before compilation
      * good in C & C++ but not too useful in more modern languages
    * Link seams
      * exploiting the scheme your language uses to resolve references
      * kinda like mocking out class methods in ruby
      * enabling point is the class path
    * Object seams
      * Best choice in OO languages
      * You have object seams everywhere in ruby since things are statically linked

- question: What is the enabling point of a seam?
  answer: |
    Every seam has an enabling point, a place where you can make the decision to use
    one behavior or another.

- question: Why are seams important?
  answer: |
    * It allows you to improve performance and change behavior
    * Seams are hidden boundaries
    * Tests often cover the edges of those boundaries
    * It's about dependencies
