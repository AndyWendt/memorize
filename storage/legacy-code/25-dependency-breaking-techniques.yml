- question: What is adapt parameter?
  answer: |
    Use it when you can't Extract Interface or when a parameter is difficult to fake.

    You find this when the parameter type is low level or specific to some implementation tech.
    If an interface is already type hinted as the parameter type, you can't have an interface of an interface.

    Don't depend on concretions.

    Basically, wrap the parameter that is coming in to break the dependency.  However, you don't preserve signatures.

    Could you preserve signatures to make it safer just to get it under test?

    Mainly a problem for languages that don't emrace duck typing?

- question: What is Break Out Method Object?
  answer: |
    Don't use this if your method is small and doesn't use instance variables.

    Use preserve signatures.

    Use this if the method is large, it uses instance variables and methods and it is difficult to get the entire
    class in a harness.

    Make getters/setters on the initial class so that the broken out object can use them if need be.

    You can also pass a data holding class to the new method object.
