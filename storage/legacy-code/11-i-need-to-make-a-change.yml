- question: What is one measure of good code in relation to effects?
  answer: |
    Complicated effects to the outside world are the sum of much simpler effects internally in
    the code.

- question: What is reasoning forward?
  answer: |
    Figure out where change can be detected and what the effects of the change are.
    Start by tracing effects from change points

- question: What are the ways that Effect Propagation happens?
  answer: |
    * Return values propagate effects to the code that calls them
    * Modifying objects that are passed in as paramters that are used later
    * Modification of static or global data that is used later

- question: What is a heuristic for looking for effects?
  answer: |
    1. Identify the method that will change
    2. If the method has a return value, look at its callers
    3. See if the method modifies any values.  If it does, look at the methods that use
       those values, and the methods that use those methods
    4. Make sure you look for superclasses and subclasses that might be users of
       these instance variables and methods
    5. Look at parameters to the methods.  See if they or any objects that their methods return
       are used by the code that you want to change
    6. Look for global variables and static data that is modified in any of the methods
       you've identified.

- question: How can programming languages assist with reasoning about effect propagation?
  answer: |
    Every language has things that can effect propagation.  If you know what they are then
    you know how far you need to look.
