- question: What is sensing in relation to breaking dependencies?
  answer: |
    It means that you need to break dependencies since you
    don't have access or you can't sense things that the code computes
    and that should be under test

- question: What is Separation in relation to breaking dependencies?
  answer: |
    Separate dependencies when you can't test code because you can't get
    it into a test harness without separating it.
