- question: What is a unit test?
  answer: |
    Two qualities to identify one: 1. does it run fast 2. does it help localize problems.

    They are tests in isolation of individual components of software that run fast.
    Those components are the most atomic behavioral units of a system.

- question: What are some of the problems with large tests?
  answer: |
    * Error localization
    * Execution time
    * Coverage: it is harder when working with higher level tests

- question: What is the purpose of unit tests?
  answer: |
    They are intended to fill in the gaps that larger tests (integration) can't.

- question: What are signs that a test is not a unit test?
  answer: |
    1. It talks to a database
    2. It communictes across a network
    3. It touches the file system
    4. You have to do special things to your environment to run it
