- question: How quickly do you recoup your investment when you make a change in legacy systems?
  answer: |
    Typically changes cluster in systems so it is likely that you'll be back to the spot in question
    soon.  However, even if it is years before you're back you'll likely have to read the code again
    and the tests and extractions will assist with your comprehension.
