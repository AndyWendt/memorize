- question: What are the disadvantages of not tackling a monster method?
  answer: |
    * They are quagmires
    * You then have to go back and attempt to understand them
    * It quite often takes more time over the long run than just refactoring the method when
      you're already there.

- question: What are the varieties of monster methods?
  answer: |
    Most of the time, the methods are combinations of the below. d
    * Bulleted: where there is little indentation
    * Snarled: dominated by a single large conditional statement

- question: |
    How should you use automated refactorings in conjunction with manual ones
    when dealing with monster methods that are not tested?
  answer: |
    Either manually refactor or automatically refactor but never both at the same time.
    The automatic refactorings (e.g. extract method) then allow you to add tests around the code
    so that you can manually refactor easier.

- question: What should be the goals of automated refactorings?
  answer: |
    * Separate logic from dependencies
    * Introduce seams that make testing easier

- question: What are possible complications with Extract Method?
  answer: |
    * Forget to pass a variable in
    * Accidently override a method in the same class or base class
    * Parameter and return value issues
    * Conversion errors (types)

- question: What is Introduce Sensing Variable?
  answer: |
    Intoduce Sensing Variable adds a variable to sense conditions (often public on the class)
    in the method that we are refactoring to aid refactoring and testing.

    They are helpful for doing refactoring deep inside of snarled methods.

    While you don't want to add behavior while refactoring, you can add code to assist with refactoring.

    Delete them after your refactoring session.

- question: What is Extract What You Know?
  answer: |
    Extract what you know that you can extract safely without tests and then add tests to cover them.

    Pay attention to the coupling count of the extraction.  Ensure that the extraction has a low coupling
    count.  Instance variables don't count usually.

    When the coupling count is greater than 0, it is often beneficial to use a Sensing Variable.

    This is a good place to start refactoring.
