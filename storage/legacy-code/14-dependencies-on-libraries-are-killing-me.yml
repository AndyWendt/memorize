- question: Should you call a library class directly?
  answer: |
    Avoid doing so.  Every direct call to a library class is a place where you could have a seam.

    You may think that you'll never change them but that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

- question: Should you use language features to enforce design contraints?
  answer: |
    Often the answer is no since using language features, such as final or sealed, can
    make testing the code nigh-on impossible.

    Coding conventions can be as impactful as restritive language features.

- question: Why should you prefer virtual methods?
  answer: |
    Since they allow for greater sensing and separation.

    Non-virtual methods are akin to private methods that you can't overwrite.
