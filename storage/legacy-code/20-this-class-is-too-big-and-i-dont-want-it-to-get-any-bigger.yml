- question: What are questions to ask to determine the main responsibility of a class?
  answer: |
    * "Why is this method here?"
    * "What is it doing for the class?"

    Legacy Code provides far more opportunities to utilize design skills than green field

- question: What are heuristics for seeing responsibilities?
  answer: |
    1. Group Methods: look for common responsibilities between methods
    2. Hidden methods: they can often hide the responsibilities of another class
      * If making a method bothers you, often it means that it needs to be on another class
    3. Look for decisions (already made not that you are making) that can change: does something seem hard coded?
      * Things happening at different levels of abstraction in the same method
      * Typically, it pays to do extract method before you extract class
    4. Look for internal relationships between instance variables and methods
      * Use feature sketches to display the lumps/interconnections between
      * You'll often see pinch points when doing this
    5. Attempt to describe the primary responsibility of a class in a single sentence
      * Keep adding clauses. What is the one thing that seems more important than others
    6. When other methods fail, do some scratch refactoring
    7. Focus on current work
      * If you're providing a different way of doing something then you might have identified a
        different responsibility that can be extracted out

- question: What are the differences between feature and effect sketches?
  answer: |
    * With feature sketches, the arrows point toward the dependencies
    * With effect skectches, the arrows point toward the things the method effects

- question: What are the two ways that the SRP can be violated?
  answer: |
    At the interface and the implementation level

- question: How do you handle a system of knarly classes?
  answer: |
    You tackle them on an as needed basis.  Doing a binge often results in more bugs and instability.
