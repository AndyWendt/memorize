    larger areas of duplication later.

- question: What should you do when two methods look roughly the same?

- question: What is one of the dangers of removing too much duplication?
  answer: |
    You can make it more difficult for clients to use your code.  In the example,
    Feathers contemplated removing the subclasses (AddEmployee, Login) of the command.
    However, that would have made it harder for the clients to use.
