- question: What are the most common issues with attempting to get a class into a test harness?
  answer: |
    1. Objects of the class can't be created easily
    2. The test harness won't easily build with the class in it
    3. The constructor we need to use has bad side effects
    4. Significant work happens in the constructor, and we need to sense it

- question: What is the best way to figure out if you can get a class into a test harness?
  answer: |
    Just do it.  Write a test case and attempt to create an object of the class.

- question: What is the case of an irritating parameter?
  answer: |
    It is where you have a parameter that is passed to the constructor of a class
    that makes the class difficult to test

- question: How do you handle an Irritating Parameter?
  answer: |
    Use fakes, mocks, stubs, or even passing null.  You might need to extract an interface.

    Pass Null and Extract Interface are two strategies for this.

    Another two are Subclass and Override Method (need to be careful of changing behavior).

- question: When should you not pass null?
  answer: |
    Never in production unless you can't avoid it.  Use the Null Object Pattern instead.
    Null objects are quite useful when a client doesn't care whether or not an operation
    was successful.

- question: Is it ok to violate rules for fakes/test code?
  answer: |
    Absolutely.  When test code isn't going on production then you can break encapsulation.

    However, the code should be clean, deduplicated (as much as is reasonable), and easy to change.

- question: What is the case of the hidden dependency?
  answer: |
    It is where the constructor makes a call to a resource that can't easily be accessed in a
    test harness.
  tags: []

- question: What are strategies to handle hidden dependency?
  answer: |
    * Parameterize Constructor (Primary one)
    * Extract Interface can also help for the parameters passed in
    * Extract and Override Getter
    * Extract and Override Factory Method
    * Supersede Instance Variable
  tags: []

- question: What is one algorithm to handle a hidden dependency safely?
  answer: |
    * create a new method that is in effect a secondary constructor
    * use that method in tests
    * Preserve the original constructor for clients

- question: What is a Construction Blob?
  answer: |
    It is where a large number of objects generated or a small number of objects are used to create a
    multitude of other objects.
  tags: []

- question: What are good refactorings for Construction Blob?
  answer: |
    * Override Factory Method can help but it can be dangerous even though it's the default here
    * Supersede Instance Variable is useful but one must be careful with memory issues
