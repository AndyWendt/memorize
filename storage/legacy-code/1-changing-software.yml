- question: Describe Improving Design/refactoring/optimization in the context of changing software
  answer: |
    Improving the design of software is an activity where no functional changes are made
    to the code but there are improvements to the code structure and design.  Tests
    ensure that the behavior doesn't change and thus leads to easier to change code.
