- question: Describe Improving Design/refactoring/optimization in the context of changing software
  answer: |
    Improving the design of software is an activity where functionality remains invariant
    but there are improvements to the code structure and design.  Tests
    ensure that the behavior doesn't change and thus leads to easier to change code.

- question: What are the downsides of avoiding changes in software?
  answer: |
    * If you avoid creating new classes and methods, the code grows larger and harder to
      understand in place
    * You fear making changes in the software even after reviewing it to make a change
    * The team gets rusty at making the changes
