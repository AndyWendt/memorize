- question: What are some of the naming conventions for tests?
  answer: |
    * Suffix Test for test classes
    * Prefix Fake for fakes
    * Prefix Testing for subclasses that are used to test parent classes only
      * When using subclass and override method

    Ergonomics is important.  You should consider how easy it is to navigate between tests and their
    implementations.
