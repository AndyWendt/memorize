- question: What are some considerations when you want to test a private method?
  answer: |
    If making it public bothers you then you should consider extracting it.

    Extraction has a couple of considerations:

    * It's basically just a utility so clients shouldn't care about it.
    * It mutates state and thus could effect the result of other methods in the class

    Good design is testable, and code that isn't testable is bad.

    The pain we feel working in a legacy code base can be an incredible impetus to change.

- question: What issues do sealed and final promote when used in public libraries?
  answer: |
    None if you're writing your code well.  Don't depend directly on libraries that are
    out of your control.  Use adapters.

- question: How should you get ideas for names?
  answer: |
    Take a look at what each piece of code does from the perspective of this class, or what it calculates
    for this class.  In addition, we should not use names that mention display components (or x components).
    Names should hide the fact.
