- question: What is hyperaware editing?
  answer: |
    It is knowing what each of our keystrokes does. Understand when the change is a behavioral change and
    when it is truly refactoring.  Tests allow you to know what the effects of a change are.  Pair programming
    does as well.

- question: Describe single-goal editing
  answer: |
    When working on changing code, focus on one type of coding at a time.  i.e. either change
    behavior or don't change behavior (refactor).  Write down ideas and come back to them.
    "Programming is the art of doing one thing at a time"

    Ask yourself: What am I doing?

- question: Describe Preserve Signatures
  answer: |
    Preserve Signatures is a way to extract/break dependencies by moving methods
    by calling a new method directly from the original one with the same set of parameters.
    This technique is particularly well suited for code that is not currently under test.

    Using this technique you copy the signature exactly from the original method and then
    remove any type declarations if needed.

- question: What are the two types of changes to code?
  answer: |
    Either it changes the behavior or it doesn't

- question: Describe Lean on the Compiler
  answer: |
    Is fundamentally two steps:

    1. Change a type declaration to raise type errors
    2. Navigate to the error locations and fix the errors

    However, it can be easy to introduce bugs when your code leans on inheritance too much.

  answer: |
    * Use it whenever you break dependencies
