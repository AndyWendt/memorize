- question: Explain Command-Query Separation
  answer: |
    Keeping methods that command and methods that query seperate makes that program
    simpler and more comprehensible.  When sent a message, you can pay it back or
    pay it forward but never both.

    For instance having a method optionally yield a job ID would not violate this principle
