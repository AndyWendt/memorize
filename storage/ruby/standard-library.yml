- question: How do you find the home directory in Ruby?  Explain
  answer: |
    `Dir.home` can be used. It depends on `$HOME` being set if you don't
    pass it an explicit user name: `Dir.home("avdi")`

    A more reliable way is to use the `etc` standard library.

    `Dir.home(Etc.getlogin)`  however, this only works on Linux.
