- question: How is a binary literal used in Ruby? And an example?
  answer: |
    A binary literal, can be used to represent file permissions.

    Instead of:

    ```
    chmod 0755, 'somefile'
    ```

    You could use:

    ```
    # U  G  O
    # rwxrwxrwx
    perms = 0b111101101
    perms.to_s(8) # => "755"
    ```

- question: How do large integer literals work? An Example?
  answer: |
    100000 could be represented as 100_000. Same for larger numbers.
    `100000 == 100_000 # true`
