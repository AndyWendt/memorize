- question: How is a binary literal used in Ruby? And an example?
  answer: |
    A binary literal, can be used to represent file permissions.

    Instead of:

    ```
    chmod 0755, 'somefile'
    ```

    You could use:

    ```
    # U  G  O
    # rwxrwxrwx
    perms = 0b111101101
    perms.to_s(8) # => "755"
    ```

- question: How do large integer literals work? An Example?
  answer: |
    100000 could be represented as 100_000. Same for larger numbers.
    `100000 == 100_000 # true`

- question: What is a character literal and when would you use it?
  answer: |
    Ruby does not have a character type distinct from the string type.  It does have a character literal syntax.
    To create one precede the character with a question mark "?".
    It is good for whenever you need to create a one character long string and enforce it.
    E.g. `when ?y`.

- question: Describe barewords and when/how to use them
  answer: |
    Use barewords to create methods since the values can come from almost anywhere
    without changing the implementation.  The implementation shouldn't care where
    the values come from.  Barewords are essentially method calls without curly's
    or attr_readers or includes.  Barewords are a concept from perl.

    Prefer using barewords

- question: Describe the `%W[]` syntax
  answer: |
    Each whitespace delimited token because a string array element.  It allows for interpolation,
    just as in double quoted strings. The advantage is that the elements read exactly as they would
    at the commandline (if calling system with the array).
