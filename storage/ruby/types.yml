- question: What are the three ways to create a symbol?
  answer: |
    Anything that can go into a string.

    To get things such as a dash `-` into a symbol, use a string and then call `to_sym`.
    `"foo-bar (baz)".to_sym`

    A more concise and idiomatic way to do this is to use a quoted string symbol:

    `:"foo-bar (baz)."`

    You can use interpolation this way as well

    There's also a percent-quote literal syntax.  `%s` followed by any delimeter you want.

    `%s{foo:bar}`

- question: Describe how the Ruby VM handles symbols
  answer: |
    The Ruby VM keeps a table in-memory of all known symbols and assigns a unique
    integer to each. Generating an unbounded set of symbols from user input can
    lead to memory leaks.
