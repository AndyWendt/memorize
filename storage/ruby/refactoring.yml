- question: Which method of invoking a system command is preferred?
  answer: |
    Passing a string: `system("ls -la")` can open up a system to injection attacks
    and the command must be passed to system's shell.

    Passing an array: `system("ls", "-la")` is preferred since it passes it off directly
    to the system for execution and it helps to protect against injection attacks.

- question: What is the Forwardable standard library good for?
  answer: |
    It's excellent when using composition to create objects. I.e. forwarding method calls
    to another object.

    ```
    extend Forwardable
    # delegate to @account
    def_delegators :@account, :foo, :bar
    #or
    def_delegators '@user.account', :foo, :bar
    ```

    While forwardable isn't as featureful as ActiveSupport::delegate, it's available in
    any Ruby installation.

- question: Describe barewords and when/how to use them
  answer: |
    Use barewords to create methods since the values can come from almost anywhere
    without changing the implementation.  The implementation shouldn't care where
    the values come from.  Barewords are essentially method calls without curly's
    or attr_readers or includes.  Barewords are a concept from perl.

    Prefer using barewords
