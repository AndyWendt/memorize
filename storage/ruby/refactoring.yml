- question: Which method of invoking a system command is preferred?
  answer: |
    Passing a string: `system("ls -la")` can open up a system to injection attacks
    and the command must be passed to system's shell.

    Passing an array: `system("ls", "-la")` is preferred since it passes it off directly
    to the system for execution and it helps to protect against injection attacks.

- question: What is the Forwardable standard library good for?
  answer: |
    It's excellent when using composition to create objects. I.e. forwarding method calls
    to another object.

    ```
    extend Forwardable
    # delegate to @account
    def_delegators :@account, :foo, :bar
    #or
    def_delegators '@user.account', :foo, :bar
    ```

    While forwardable isn't as featureful as ActiveSupport::delegate, it's available in
    any Ruby installation.
