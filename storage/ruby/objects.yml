- question: Describe how to define your own constructor and why it is valuable?
  answer: |
    Defining your own constructor is helpful since you might have multiple ways/reasons
    for instantiating a class.  For instance, Point might have an initializer for point
    and cartesian coordinates.

    `new` and `initialize` are just ordinary methods.

    Steps to creating your own constructor:
      1. Allocate a new, empty object
      2. Run specialized initialization
      3. Return the initialized instance

    What this could look like for setting instance variables x,y:

    ```ruby
    class Point
      def self.my_new(x,y)
        instance = allocate
        instance.instance_variable_set(:@x, x)
        instance.instance_variable_set(:@x, y)
        instance
      end
    end
    ```

    However,

    ```ruby
    class Point
      def self.my_new(*args, &block)
        instance = allocate
        instance.my_initialize(*args, &block)
        instance
      end

      def my_initialize(x,y)
        @x = x
        @y = y
      end
    end
    ```

- question: How do you ensure that a class cannot be instantiated through the usual way?
  answer: |
    Make the `new` method private

    ```ruby
    class Snowflake
      class << self
        private :new
      end

      def self.instance
        @instance ||= new
      end
    end

    Snowflake.instance # => #<Snowflake:0x00000004af4db8>
    Snowflake.instance # => #<Snowflake:0x00000004af4db8>

    Snowflake.new
    ```

    You could also write the above using Ruby's `Singleton` library:

    ```ruby
    require 'singleton'
    class TheOne
      include Singleton
    end

    TheOne.instance # => #<TheOne:0x00000004a0b190>
    TheOne.instance # => #<TheOne:0x00000004a0b190>
    TheOne.new
    ```

- question: What is `object.tap`'s purpose and usage?
  answer: |
    It's used to modify the current object and return the result as the current object and NOT the assigned value

    For example:

    ```
    def fizz_factory_1
      fizz_object = Struct.new(:fizz).new
      fizz_object.fizz = 'foo'
      fizz_object
    end

    def fizz_factory_2
      Struct.new(:fizz).new.tap { |obj|  obj.fizz = 'foo' }
    end

    fizz_factory_1.fizz == fizz_factory_2.fizz # true
    ```

- question: "What is the search sequence when attempting to find a symbol in Ruby?"
  answer: |
    1. Each entry in `Module.nesting`
    2. Each entry in `Module.nesting.first.ancestors`
    3. Each entry in `Object.ancestors` if `Module.nesting.first` is `nil` or a module.
  tags: []

- question: "Explain Ruby Constant Lookup"
  answer: |
    Loosely speaking, the search first works upwards through the nesting at the point of reference,
    then upwards through either the inheritance chain of the containing class (if there is one), or
    that of `Object` otherwise.

- question: Are functions first class citizens in ruby?
  answer: |
    No, they're not. You cannot assign a function to a variable and
    immediately use it. However, you can retrieve a method from an
    object to use it.

- question: What does `my_instance.my_method` represent?
  answer: |
    Sending the `my_method` message to the `my_instance` object

    * A message is a name for a responsibility an object may have.
    * A method is a named, concrete piece of code that encodes one way
      a responsibility may be fulfilled.  A method by which a message might
      be implemented.

- question: What is the preferred way to create singleton objects in ruby?
  answer: |
    Using a singleton instance of object is a bit more intention revealing than using a module since
    modules are typically used as namespaces and as means of sharing behavior.

    ```
    class << (LIVE_CELL = Object.new)
      def to_s() 'o' end

      def next_generation(x, y, board)
        case board.neighbors(x,y).count(LIVE_CELL)
        when 2..3 then self
        else DEAD_CELL
        end
      end
    end
    ```

- question: How do singleton objects differ from the singleton pattern?
  answer: |
    The singleton pattern tends to manage quite a bit of centralized state whereas
    singleton objects are stateless. They are thus somewhat less prone to abuse.

- question: "How do you call the parent implementation with the child's implementation arguments?"
  answer: "Call `super` without arguments"

- question: "How do you ensure that a block is not passed to the parent?"
  answer: "`super(&nil)` will ensure that a block is not passed to the parent"

- question: How can you log a `send` call?
  answer: Use the `logged_send()` method
  tags: []

- question: How do you call the original method that was overridden in a module?
  answer: |
    * Retrive it using: `original_send = Object.instance_method(:send)`
    * Then bind it to self: `bound_send = original_send.bind(self)`
    * Then call it: `bound_send.call(name, *args, &block)`
