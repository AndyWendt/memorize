- question: "When code depends on a hash value being present, nested or not, how should you retrieve the value and WHY?"
  answer: |
    A regular hash call without a key present returns `nil`.  A chained call will return
      `NoMethodError (undefined method [] for nil:NilClass)`.  Unfortunately, it fails far away from where
      the values are added to the hash.
    Using `Hash#fetch()` raises a `key not found error`  Raises the error right where the information is supplied.
