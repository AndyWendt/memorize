- question: "What are entities?"
  tags: [tactical]
  answer: >
    Entities are often mutable (though not of necessity) objects that are unique even when their values
    correalate to objects of the same type (in contrast to a value object).

- question: "What are the dangers of over-abstracting?"
  tags: []
  answer: |
    - The language of the abstractions does not match the language of the model.  This language will creep into the user domain.
    - Makes it difficult to model the individual types
    - Leads to a complex heirarchy and special cases
    - An excessive amount of code because you're trying to solve an unsolvable problem and attempting to solve future needs that are unknown

- question: "What are the steps/rules to creating a right-sized aggregate?"
  tags: []
  answer: |
    1. Start off by creating one entity per aggregate and making it the root.
    2. Determine the aggregates that will require reactionary updates due to an aggregate being updated
    3. Determine how much time may elapse before the reaction updates, in two, happen.
    4. Aggregates that must be updated together immediately likely should be in the same aggregate.
    5. Reacting Aggregates that can be updated after N amount of time should follow the eventual consistency rule

- question: "What are the rules of Aggregate design?"
  tags: []
  answer: |
    1. Protect business invariants inside Aggregate boundaries
    2. Design small Aggregates.
    3. Reference Other Aggregates by Identity Only
    4. Update Other Aggregates Using Eventual Consistency

- question: "Describe the first rule of aggregate design"
  tags: []
  answer: |
    **Protect Business Invariants inside Aggregate Boundaries**
    The business should ultimately determine Aggregate compositions based on what must
    be consistent when a transaction is committed.

- question: "Describe the second rule of aggregate design"
  tags: []
  answer: |
    **Design Small Aggregates**
    The memory footprint and transactional scope of each Aggregate should be relatively small. Whenever needed,
    break up larger aggregates into smaller aggregates so that each Aggregate will be easier to work on.
    If your Aggregate is trying to do too many things, it is not following SRP.

- question: "Describe the third rule of aggregate design"
  tags: []
  answer: |
    **Reference Other Aggregates by Identity Only**
    This helps keep Aggregates small and prevents reaching out to modify multiple Aggregates in the same transaction.

- question: "Describe the fourth rule of aggregate design"
  tags: []
  answer: |
    **Update Other Aggregates Using Eventual Consistency**
    Other aggregates should be eventually consistent with the aggregate that you're currently updating.

- question: "Describe the fifth rule of aggregate design"
  tags: []
  answer: "There is no fifth rule"

- question: "Describe an Anemic Domain Model"

  answer: >
    Where all of your Aggregates have only public accessors but no real business behavior.  All of the overhead with
    none of the benefits.  Business logic can also leak into the Application Services above your model.
