- question: "What are the dangers of over-abstracting?"
  tags: []
  answer: >
    - The language of the abstractions does not match the language of the model.  This language will creep into the user domain.
    - Makes it difficult to model the individual types
    - Leads to a complex heirarchy and special cases
    - An excessive amount of code because you're trying to solve an unsolvable problem and attempting to solve future needs that are unknown
