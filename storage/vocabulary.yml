- question: Heuristic
  answer: |
    A heuristic technique (/hjʊəˈrɪstɪk/; Ancient Greek: εὑρίσκω, "find" or "discover"), or a heuristic, is any approach
    to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal,
    perfect or rational, but which is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal.
