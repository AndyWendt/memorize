- quote: |
    Architects are usually charged with the task of working out the big picture and making decisions that
    preserve the big picture for the team.  That can work, but there is one strong caveat.
    An architect has to be out in the team working with the members day-to-day, or else the coding diverges
    from the big picture....  The brutal truth is that architecture is too important to be left exclusively
    to a few people.  It's fine to have an architect, but the key way to keep an architecture intact is to make
    sure that everyone on the team knows what it is and has a stake in it.
