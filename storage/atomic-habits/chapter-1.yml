- question: What is the relative importance of massive one-time improvement versus daily, small improvement?
  answer: |
    In our minds we believe that the major impactful changes are the ones that everyone will remember.  However,
    it is the daily, largely unnoticeable, improvements that create lasting change and ones that people will
    ultimately remember and acknowledge.

- question: Why are single small decisions so important?
  answer: |
    Bad and good habits compound.  It may be ok to ignore your family and work on a project. Or, procrastinate but
    the 1 percent errors add up.

    1 percent errors compound into toxic results.

    They are the difference between who you are and who you could be.

- question: What is the Plateau of Latent Potential?
  answer: |
    It is the area where you often do not see significant improvment.
    You need to cross the Plateau to see the results that have been building
    up over time.

    People will call this build up an overnight success but it is anything but.

    Progress is not Linear.

- question: What is the difference between goals and systems in regards to self-improvement?
  answer: |
    The goal is what you attain whereas the system is how you attain it.
    Focusing on the system generates greater results than just focusing on the goal.

    They are only a momentary achievement and they suffer from survivorship bias.

    Both groups can have the same goal but the system is the ultimate determiner.

    Don't solve systems problems at the results level.
