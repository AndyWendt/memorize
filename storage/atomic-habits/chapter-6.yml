- question: What is the most common form of change?
  answer: |
    That which is external.  Every habit is context dependent.

    The majority of our choices are driven by the most obvious choice (a trigger) and not by purpose driven choices.

- question: How do objects in our environment relate to our behaviors and the context thereof?
  answer: |
    We have relationships with them that define our triggers for our habits.  This is the context in which
    habits happen.

- question: How do our behaviors relate to the spaces that we live in?
  answer: |
    One space, one use.  Different spaces come with different behavioral baggage.  Use a new space or
    change your current space to make it easer to start a new habit or end an old one.

    Avoid mixing the context of one habit with another.  In a small area, divide your room into activity zones
    utilizing chairs, desks, etc.
