- question: How do tribes influence our habits?
  answer: |
    We look to the group for guidance on how to act if we are unsure.  You can buck the group but it is
    difficult.  The human mind innately wants to get along with others. If you join a new group and they use
    an inferior strategy, chances are that you will adopt that inferior strategy.

- question: How do the actions of the powerful influence our actions?
  answer: |
    Once we fit into the group we seek to stand out.  We revere the habits of the successful.

    If a habit brings us approval, status, praise, then we want it even more.
