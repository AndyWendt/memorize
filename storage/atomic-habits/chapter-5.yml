- question: What is an implementation intention?
  answer: |
    It is a plan for when and where you will invoke a certain habit.  This is
    key since it uses two cues, time and place, to identify when the habit
    should take place.

    The format is: I will [behavior] at [time] in [location].

    When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.

    Motivation often isn't the issue, it's clarity. And the implementation intention provides that.

- question: What is Habit Stacking?
  answer: |
    It is where you pair a new habit with an existing one.

    "After [current habit], I will [new habit]"

    The secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.

- question: What cues are best for habit stacking?
  answer: |
    Highly specific and immediately actionable. Do not allow ambiguity: I will do ten push-ups after I close my laptop
    for lunch.
