- question: Why are bad habits hard to break?
  answer: |
    They are autocatalytic.  They feed themselves.

    do anything else.

    It's a downward spiral

- question: How do you change your bad habits to good habits long term?
  answer: |
    You must change the environment.  You can hold out will power wise for quite awhile but it won't last
    forever.  You must change your environment from a negative to a positive one.

    Make it invisible.  Self-control is a short-term strategy.  Not a long-term one.
