- question: What is the problem with focusing on outcomes when changing behavior?
  answer: |
    When you focus on outcomes you don't change your view of your self.  Saying "I'm trying to quit smoking",
    signals that you are still a smoker.  Saying "I don't smoke" says that you are NOT a smoker.

    Changing your identity is more powerful since you then start to shape your viewpoint of the world around it.

    When outcomes are coupled with processes, the behavior change is typically short-lived.
    You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven't changed who you are.
    When identity change is coupled with process and outcomes it results in successful behavior change.

    Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.
