- question: What is the problem with focusing on outcomes when changing behavior?
  answer: |
    When you focus on outcomes you don't change your view of your self.  Saying "I'm trying to quit smoking",
    signals that you are still a smoker.  Saying "I don't smoke" says that you are NOT a smoker.

    Changing your identity is more powerful since you then start to shape your viewpoint of the world around it.

    When outcomes are coupled with processes, the behavior change is typically short-lived.
    You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven't changed who you are.
    When identity change is coupled with process and outcomes it results in successful behavior change.

    Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

  answer: |
    If the individual or group identity is negative, then you will typically believe
    it since it has been reinforced for years.

    Examples:

    * I can't do X
    * I am terrible with X
    * I am not X

- question: How do behaviors influence your identity?
  answer: |
    They are the building blocks of identity.  The ones that are repeated daily
    are what generate that identity.    This is what leads to the micro evolutions
    and incremental improvement.

- question: What is the two-step process to a new identity?
  answer: |
    1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
    2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

    Start from the results and work backward to the type of person who
    can get those results to define your focus.
