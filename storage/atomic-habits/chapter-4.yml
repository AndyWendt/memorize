- question: What is the first step in changing habits?
  answer: |
    It is defining what your current ones are.  It is similar to a characterization test when

- question: What is an effective technique to increase habit awareness from a subconcious to concious level?
  answer: |
    Use the Point-and-Calling technique.  A common example is pointing and vocalizing essential items
    that you need before you leave the house.  "I have my car keys (point), I have my wallet (point), etc".

    How might this technique be used when we are writing software to improve awareness?

    e.g. "I'm about to use the mouse instead of a keyboard shortcut...I'm going to use keyboard shortcuts
    to be more productive"

    Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real.  You're getting yourself
    to acknowledge the need for action.
