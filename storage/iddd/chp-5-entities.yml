  tags: []

- question: "What should you focus on when first designing an entity?"
  answer: |
    The attributes and properties that uniquely define its behavior and identity.
    Strip away the behavior and the excess properties that are not essential to the concept.

- question: "Why use Entities instead of Value Objects to store unique identity?"
  answer: |
    So that the behavior associated with that identity can be centralized instead of spread out and leaking.

- question: "What are reasonable ways to get users to define unique and correct identities?"
  answer: |
    Use design discussions to devise workflows to safely define human-readable unique identities

- question: "What is an ideal example of an application generated identity?"
  answer: "UUID"

- question: |
    When identities are passed between Bounded Contexts, what is a good strategy to encapsulate
    the information?
  answer: |
    A Value Object since it allows for retrieval of the ID as well as meta information such as creation date.

- question: "What is one way to reduce the performance burden of DB generated IDs?"
  answer: Use a Repository to cache sequence/increment values

- question: "Describe the types of database identity generation and assignment"
  answer: |
    * Early happens before Entity persistence
    * Late happens after Entity persistence

- question: "What Pattern would be useful to support both types of Identity generation?"
  answer: "Repository"

- question: "How is an Entities' ID selected when it resides in another Bounded Context?"
  answer: "A fuzzy search combined with user selection from that search"
  tags: []

- question: "How could updates be handled when another Bounded Context assigns identity?"
  answer: "Event-driven architecture with Domain Events"

- question: "How do you handle concept differences between autonomous Contexts?"
