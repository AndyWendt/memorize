- question: |
    How do you protect against invariants so that an Entity is not peristed
    which is older than the one currenly peristed?
  answer: Use a version number and reject updates that are older

- question: What are issues with large-cluster Aggregates?
  answer: |
    - False invariants/constraints imposed by the developers
    - Transactional issues
    - Performance and scalability issues
  tags: []

- question: How do you discover which objects should be in an Aggregate?
  answer: By determining what a model's true invariants are?
  tags: []

- question: What is an invariant?
  answer: |
    It is a business rule that must be transactionally consistent
    (as opposed to eventually consisten) i.e. atomic and immediate
  tags: []

- question: What does an aggregate double as?
  answer: A transactional consistency boundary
  tags: []

- question: Why is transactional analysis useful when designing aggregates
  answer: Because you cannot correctly reason about aggregate design without it
  tags: []

- question: What is the definition of a properly designed aggregate?
  answer: |
    One that can be modified in any way required by the business while
    maintaining single transaction invariant consistency
  tags: []

- question: Describe examples of large cluster aggregates
  answer: answers will vary
  tags: []

- question: How do object graphs play into aggregates?
  answer: |
    Aggregates are chiefly about consistency boundaries so object graphs
    are not their primary concern.
  tags: []

- question: Describe a small aggregate
  answer: |
    Limit the aggregate to only necessary entities, attributes, and values.
    A starting minimum is a root entity, minimum number of attributes,
    and or value type properties.

- question: What are necessary elements of an Aggregate?
  answer: |
    Those that must be consistent with the others even if domain experts
    don't specify them as such.

- question: What are questions to ask about the persistence of multiple aggregates?
  answer: |
    If the persistence of multiple aggregates is confined to one transaction, be skeptical
