- question: What three things influence whether to adopt tdd or not?
  answer: |
    Method, motive, and opportunity.  Motive is not under your control
    since you likely will not be able to simulate the circumstances
    necessary to create said motive.

    However, method and opportunity are largely under the control of the
    developers.
