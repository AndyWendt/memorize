- question: When testing something that is challenging, what test should you start with (starter test)?
  answer: |
    Test an invariant that does nothing.  One of the first questions that you should
    ask yourself when writing a test is "where does this operation belong?"

    Beginning with a real test will leave you too long without feedback

    Start with inputs and outputs that are trivially easy to discover

    Starter tests are often application level.
