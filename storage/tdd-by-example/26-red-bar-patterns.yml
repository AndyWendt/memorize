- question: When testing something that is challenging, what test should you start with (starter test)?
  answer: |
    Test an invariant that does nothing.  One of the first questions that you should
    ask yourself when writing a test is "where does this operation belong?"

    Beginning with a real test will leave you too long without feedback

    Start with inputs and outputs that are trivially easy to discover

    Starter tests are often application level.

- question: When you are tired or stuck, what should you do?
  answer: |
    TDD provides ways to get around mental blocks:  obvious implementation, fake it, triangulation.
    If you still can't get around the mental block, Take a break. The shower methodology.

    When taking the break, evaluate the days goals and see if they still make sense and the implications
    for your team and project.

    Sometimes you do need to push on and press through it but oftentimes you just need to step away.
