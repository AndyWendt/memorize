- question: Describe the Null Object Pattern
  answer: |
    Essentially you represent a special case, null, with an object.  It has the same interface as the class
    that you are creating a null object for.  There are tradeoffs for this, however.

- question: Describe template method
  answer: |
    It allows for the representation of invariants while allowing for future refinement through the use of
    inheritance and abstract methods.

    It is a method that only calls methods (a template).

    Best found through experience.

- question: Describe Pluggable Selector Pattern
  answer: |
    Use reflection or meta programming to invoke a method rather than a concrete switch statement
    since they get repetative.

    Use it when there was inheritance with multiple claseses who each only had one method.

- question: Describe Factory Method
  answer: |
    It is a method that creates an object. The downside of it is that there's indirection.  The updside,
    easy of use.
