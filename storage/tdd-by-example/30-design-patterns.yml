- question: Describe the Null Object Pattern
  answer: |
    Essentially you represent a special case, null, with an object.  It has the same interface as the class
    that you are creating a null object for.  There are tradeoffs for this, however.

- question: Describe template method
  answer: |
    It allows for the representation of invariants while allowing for future refinement through the use of
    inheritance and abstract methods.

    It is a method that only calls methods (a template).

    Best found through experience.
