- question: Why should you write clean code that works through TDD?
  answer: |
    * It's a predictable way to develop since you know when you're finished
    * It gives you a chance to learn all of the lessons that the code can teach you
    * It improves the user experience
    * It lets your teammates count on you
    * It feels good to write it

- question: How does TDD change the development lifecycle?
  answer: |
    * Developers design the code as they go.  No big upfront design.
      The design evolves organically as you progress through the code
    * Developers write their own tests
    * Developers must write code that is highly-cohesive and loosely coupled.
