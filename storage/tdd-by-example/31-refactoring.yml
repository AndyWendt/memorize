- question: What is observational equivalence?
  answer: |
    It is realizing that you need to write the appropriate number of tests to get the appropriate code
    coverage to allow for refactoring.  Don't check code in that hasn't been tested thoroughly and would
    fail silently if refactored.

- question: How do you reconcile differences?
  answer: |
    You gradually bring the two pieces of code closer together and then combine them when they are identical.

    Often it is best by envisioning the last step.  If you want to eliminate an abstract class, you'll need to remove
    all of the functionality from it and thus all of its methods.

- question: Describe isolate change
  answer: |
    Use it to make a concept clearer and easier to change in a multipart object.  Use Extract Method, Extract Object,
    and Method Object.  Sometimes the additional indirection isn't worth it.  You have to balance it out.
